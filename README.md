Yan_Chrome_Plugin
=================

Yan is an application suite combining Evernote-like web clipping, cloud-mobile synchronization and text-to-speech technologies. 
It endeavors to create a user experience enable people to enjoy the excessive information in a more convenient and handy way. 
Yan is a capstone project of my Real World Software Engineering class in CMU. I individually developed the rails server and Chrome plugin.
As we are running into some non-tech issues on releasing the product, I have decided to open source part of our product. This is the plugin part.
